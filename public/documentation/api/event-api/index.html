  <p>While Parse API allows you to work directly with incoming email, SendGrid&#8217;s Event API gives you hooks to develop direct integration, linking your application or service with our powerful notification features. To kick this off, SendGrid will notify a URL of your choice with events that occur as SendGrid processes your messages in real-time. This feature delivers raw data to your log server to be collected. Once there, you can pull out the data and convert it into any kind of helpful information you like.</p>

<p>A common use of this kind of data is to collect information about how specific mail campaigns or categories of mailings are progressing. There are all of the standard Event Types, listed in detail below, but you can really customize your data with data that you need. Using the Unique Arguments and Category parameters, you can insert dynamic data that will help build a sharp, clear image of your mailings.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>FROM THE BLOG >> </strong>If you&#8217;d like to see how one of our customers uses Event API, check out <a href="http://sendgrid.com/blog/leveraging-sendgrids-event-api/">Leveraging SendGrid&#8217;s Event API post from TeamSnap&#8217;s H. Wade Minter</a>.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Requests</h2>

<p>You have the option to receive a <strong>HTTP POST</strong> request for each event or to receive a batch of multiple events in one request after a very short delay. These POSTs will be sent to the URL you have defined in the Event Notification app options.</p>

<p>SendGrid expects a 200 HTTP response to the POST, otherwise the event notification will be retried. If your URL returns a non-200 HTTP code it will be deferred and retried for 24 hours. The maximum number of deferred POSTs in the retry queue is 100,000. If the queue is full, the oldest request in the queue will be removed to make room for the newest deferred POST. This means that if you use batched events these events will drop due to 24 hours before the queue can max out. Events that cannot be submitted within the maximum retry period or events removed from the defer queue will be lost.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>NOTE >> </strong>If your email traffic and configuration generate many events, the incoming amount of data can easily overload a web server if not configured properly for scalability. In cases where this may happen, you may want to use the batched events option.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Event Types</h2>

<p>The following lists the events generated by SendGrid.</p>

<p>Event
Criteria</p>

<p>Processed</p>

<p>Message has been received and is ready to be delivered.</p>

<p>Dropped</p>

<p>Recipient exists in one or more of your Suppression Lists: Bounces, Spam Reports, Unsubscribes.</p>

<p>Delivered</p>

<p>Message has been successfully delivered to the receiving server.</p>

<p>Deferred</p>

<p>Recipient&#8217;s email server temporarily rejected message. Refer to our article on <a href="/docs/email-deliverability/what-is-throttling/">throttling</a>.</p>

<p>Bounce</p>

<p>Receiving server could not or would not accept message.</p>

<p>Spam Report</p>

<p>Recipient marked message as spam.</p>

<p>Unsubscribe</p>

<p>Recipient clicked on messages&#8217;s subscription management link.</p>

<p>The following image shows where events can be generated as email is being processed:</p>

<p><img src="http://docs.sendgrid.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/eventflow.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h2>Parameters</h2>

<p>The following is a list of parameters that are always passed with each event. Some events include additional parameters. Also a category name and custom argument may be passed. Please see the Custom Parameters and Categories section below for more information.</p>

<p>Parameter
Description</p>

<p>event</p>

<p>One of: bounce, click, deferred, delivered, dropped, processed, open, spamreport, unsubscribe</p>

<p>email</p>

<p>Email address of the intended recipient</p>

<h2>Custom Parameters and Categories</h2>

<p>Events generated by SendGrid can also include custom parameters. To define and receive custom parameters in your URL the <a href="/documentation/api/smtp-api/">SMTP API</a> must be used when sending emails using the <em>unique_args</em> argument. For example, if you have an application and want to receive custom parameters such as the user id and the email template name you can send your email in the following way:</p>

<p>If sending through SMTP include the following email header:</p>

<p><code>X-SMTPAPI: {"unique_args":{"userid":"1123","template":"welcome"}}</code></p>

<p>If sending over HTTP use the following parameter:</p>

<p><code>x-smtpapi={"unique_args":{"userid":"1123","template":"welcome"}}</code></p>

<p>Either of those emails will generate the following HTTP POST request to your application when the email is opened:</p>

<p><code>email=emailrecipient@domain.com&amp;event;=open&amp;userid;=1123&amp;template;=welcome</code></p>

<h2>Categories</h2>

<p>If a <a href="http://docs.sendgrid.com/documentation/delivery-metrics/categories/">category</a> is used over the SMTP API to get detailed statistics for <em>user signups</em> in addition to custom parameters the following is needed: If sending through SMTP include the following email header:</p>

<p><code>X-SMTPAPI: {"unique_args":{"userid":"1123","template":"welcome"},"category":"user_signup"}</code></p>

<p>If sending over HTTP use the following parameter:</p>

<p><code>x-smtpapi={"unique_args":{"userid":"1123","template":"welcome"},"category":"user_signup"}</code></p>

<p>Either of those emails will generate the following HTTP POST request to your application when the email is opened:</p>

<p><code>email=emailrecipient@domain.com&amp;event;=open&amp;userid;=1123&amp;template;=welcome&amp;category;=user_signup</code></p>

<blockquote><p><strong>NOTE >> </strong>If you apply multiple categories to any of your outgoing messages, the returned data will be in the form of an array.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Batched Events</h2>

<p>Batched event POSTs have a content-type header of <em>application/json</em>, and contain exactly one JSON string per line, with each line representing one event. Please note that currently the POST headers define this post as <em>application/json</em>, though it&#8217;s not; each line is a valid JSON string, but the overall POST body is not. For example:</p>

<p><code>
{"email":"foo@bar.com","timestamp":1322000095,"unique_arg":"my unique arg","event":"delivered"}
{"email":"foo@bar.com","timestamp":1322000096,"unique_arg":"my unique arg","event":"open"}
</code></p>

<blockquote><p><strong>NOTE >> </strong>Batched events currently post every 1 second, or when the batch size reaches 1MB (one megabyte), whichever occurs first.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE >> </strong>Batching your events will result in better performance for a number of reasons. Batches reduce server load and reduce the number of open connections. Batches can give you additional information based on their size and when they are collected, something that you cannot generate from custom categories. Finally, batching events is healthy and good for the heart.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Setup</h2>

<p>To setup the event API, login and go to the <a href="http://sendgrid.com/app">apps page</a>, click on Show Disabled Apps, click the Event Notification app, and click on settings. Check the boxes next to the type of events you want posted to your web server, then enter in the URL you have setup to receive POSTs from our servers when an event occurs.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;d like to receive batched events, check the &#8220;Batch event notifications&#8221; checkbox to enable the feature, then click the save button. This will not, however, turn on the function. To do that, return to the Apps page and click on enable on the Event Notification app.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>NOTE >> </strong>We now support basic authentication in our Event API.  Those who wish to implement can provide credentials in the post event url field on the app settings page.  Below is an example of the post url with authentication included.</p></blockquote>

<p><code>http(s)://username:password@domain/foo.php</code></p>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>The following examples will use PHP language, the Web API to send email using <em>curl</em>, and the <a href="/documentation/api/smtp-api/">SMTP API</a> for the <em>X-SMTPAPI</em> parameter when sending email. Many times is useful to see all parameters that are being POSTed. The following example receives a <strong>batched</strong> POST and dumps the parameters to a log file located at /tmp/dump.log:</p>

<p><code>
ok</code></p>

<p>If you&#8217;re <strong>not batching</strong>, the code would look like:</p>

<p><code>
ok
</code></p>

<blockquote><p><strong>NOTE >> </strong>If you are using a hosting service, you don&#8217;t have direct access to the server&#8217;s file system. In that case, you need to modify the path for the dump log to be somewhere you <em>do</em> have access to. In most cases, the second line in the code above&#8230;</p></blockquote>

<p><code>$fh = fopen('/tmp/dump.log', 'a+');</code>
should be changed to&#8230;</p>

<p><code>$fh = fopen('~/dump.log', 'a+');</code></p>

<blockquote><p><strong>WARNING >> </strong>Be sure to confirm with your hosting provider that they support PHP. Hosting services that offer Linux servers almost invariably support PHP, but services that offer Windows IIS-based servers may not. It may simply come down to which server package you have selected, and some free services do not offer PHP support.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Parameter Details</h2>

<p>The following shows each type of event that can be posted along with the specific parameters that go along with the event.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>NOTE >> </strong>You can use the SMTP API to specify additional custom parameters including categories and unique args. Each unique arg is posted as a separate post parameter, similar to the category listed below, but with a custom name specified by you.</p></blockquote>

<p><code>POST /myurl.php HTTP/1.1 User-agent: Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; U; AnyEvent-HTTP/2.03; +http://software.schmorp.de/pkg/AnyEvent) Connection: close Te Content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded Te: trailers Content-length: 72 Referer: http://mydomain.com/myurl.php Host: mydomain.com arg2=2&amp;email;=test@domain.com&amp;arg1;=1&amp;category;=testing&amp;event;=open</code></p>

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

<p>Ensure that your web server is returning a 200 response to our servers. Any other response type will result in our server retrying a POST until we receive a 200 response or the maximum time has expired. All events are retried at increasing intervals for up to three days after the event occurs. Make sure you are not blocking our IPs that are trying to POST to your server. Our IPs change often since we constantly add more machines. Also, you can try a test POST yourself from a terminal by running the following command. This will give you the full response your server is returning including the HTTP headers.</p>

<p><code>curl -i -d 'email=test@gmail.com&amp;arg2;=2&amp;arg1;=1&amp;category;=testing&amp;event;=processed'</code></p>
