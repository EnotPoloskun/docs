# SendGrid Documentation

This site is based on Octopress, which is in turn based on Jekyll, with a dash of Twitter Bootstrap added.

## Setup

* Clone the repo. Run <code>bundle install</code>.
* Set your root (if you're running locally it'll just be /) in _config.yml
* Run rake preview
* Browse to localhost:4000

## Important Things to Know

* This repo currently has both the source and some generated files. The source files are in  /source, and the generated files are in /public. They get overwritten or wiped out when the site is rebuilt. I will be removing the generated files from the site soon and adding the /public folder to .gitignore

* To rebuild the site: <code>rake generate</code>

* To deploy the site to an s3 bucket (requires s3tools configured with AWS key and secret, and bucket name specified in \_config.yml): <code>rake gzip\_deploy</code>. This gzips all the content and pushes to an s3 bucket with the correct Content-Encoding header, as well as adding Expires header info for .js and .css pages.

## Config

The only config variables you should need to know about are <code>root</code>, which is the root from which all links are calculated, and the <code>folder_weights</code> hash, which specifies the order that the folders should be displayed in the nav tree. Higher weights mean higher display priority (higher in the tree).

There's also a <code>version</code> number in the config, which is displayed on the site footer.

### The Nav Tree

The nav tree is generated by the plugin site_navigation.rb. It is essentially a recursive traversal of all the folders and pages in the Source folder that generates a hierarchical tree, sorted by folder weight and page weight.

Breadcrumbs are generated by the breadcrumbs.rb plugin.

### Pages

You can write pages in markdown, HTML, or HAML. They all get converted to HTML when the site is generated.

Pages have a block of YAML at the top that sets a few options. They are pretty self explanatory; here's an example

<code>
	---
	layout: page
	weight: 0
	title: Docs Home
	icon: icon-home
	showTitle: false
	navigation:
	  show: true
	---
</code>

Weights are same as the folder weights - the higher numbers move higher up the tree. Icons are based on the CSS icon class names from Twitter Bootstrap. showTitle and navigation["show"] both default to true if not specified.

## JS and CSS, etc
JavaScript and CSS are minified and combined using Juicer. The files to be packaged and their orders are specified in JsMinify.yml and CssMinify.yml respectively. Image files referenced in CSS files are embedded as data-uri information, assuming they are not too large.
