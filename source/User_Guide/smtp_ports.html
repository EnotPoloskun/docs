<p>Many hosting providers and ISPs block port 25 as a default practice. When trying to connect to smtp.sendgrid.net remember that ports 25, 2525, 587, and 465 are all available for use.</p>

<p>You can connect via unencrypted or TLS on ports 25, 2525, and 587.
You can connect via SSL on port 465.</p>
