##What is SendGrid?

SendGrid is a cloud-based [SMTP provider]("http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMTP" "SMTP on Wikipedia") that allows you to send email without having to maintain email servers. SendGrid manages all of the technical details, from scaling the infrastructure to ISP outreach and reputation monitoring to whitelist services and real time analytics. 

Our goal is to make it as easy as possible to add reliable, scalable email to your application so that you can focus on building the core features of your product.

##Who is SendGrid for?

SendGrid is for anyone that needs to send email, whether it's [transactional email]("http://docs.sendgrid.com/documentation/get-started/terms-and-definitions" "SMTP on Wikipedia") or marketing newsletters and campaigns. We send billions of emails each month, so we can handle your email regardless of volume.

###Developers

For developers, it's super easy to get started. To send email through SendGrid from your code, just change your email configuration to point to our servers and include the credentials for your SendGrid account, and you're done. If you're not already sending email from your app, we have a variety of [integration options]("http://docs.sendgrid.com/documentation/get-started/integrate/") for you.

Once you've got email sending squared away, check out some of the other awesome things you can do with our [APIs]("http://docs.sendgrid.com/documentation/api/" "SendGrid APIs") and [apps]("http://docs.sendgrid.com/documentation/apps/" "SendGrid Apps").

###Marketers

Our newsletter feature let you compose and send email campaigns from a powerful web-based tool. We provide list management, delivery scheduling, A/B split testing, and of course we provide analytics on the emails you send. You can take a look at our [newsletter documentation]("http://docs.sendgrid.com/documentation/newsletter-app/", "Newsletter Documentaiton") to learn more.

We also provide a robust [newsletter API]("http://docs.sendgrid.com/documentation/api/newsletter-api/" "Newsletter API") if you want to integrate any of these features into your own application.
