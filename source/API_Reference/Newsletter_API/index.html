<p>SendGrid has a Newsletter API that allows users to access data and interact with the Newsletter functionality of SendGrid website. We also have a <a href="{{root_url}}/Newsletters/index.html">Newsletter web interface</a>.</p>

<p>The Newsletter API provides developers with the ability to manage newsletters, lists, identities, and schedule delivery events. This can be very useful in allowing development teams to propagate data in and out of the web based Newsletter App that can be easily used by members of the company with little or no programming expertise.</p>

<p>The Newsletter API is very similar to the Web API in that it follows the same convention and format, and utilizes the same technology; http requests. This is done with <strong>http</strong> requests to the SendGrid site with a variety of parameters to organize data. All query responses can be provided in either JSON or XML.<br></p>

URL Format

<p>The following is the syntax for making Newsletter API requests:</p>

<code>

</code>

<ul>
	<li><strong>[action]</strong> - Each module supports multiple actions such as add, get, and delete.</li>
	
	<li><strong>[format]</strong> - This determines the response format. It can be either json for a JSON response or xml for an XML response.</li>
	
</ul>

	<li><strong>2XX</strong> - The API call was successful.</li>
	<li><strong>4XX</strong> - The API call had an error in the parameters. The error will be encoded in the body of the response.</li>
	<li><strong>5XX</strong> - The API call was unsuccessful. You should retry later.</li>
