<p>Sections are an extension of <a href="{{root_url}}/API_Reference/SMTP_API/substitution_tags.html">substitution values</a> that allow a user to specify large text blocks that will be mostly the same that can then be selected and customized on a per user basis. This is useful for sending dynamic content where a large section of the body will be similar across several users, as opposed to duplicating that text each time. </p>

<p>The format of the SMTP section key has the form:</p>

{% codeblock lang:json %}{
  "section": {
    "-sectionName1-": "section 1 text",
    "sectionName2": "section 2 text"
  }
}
{% endcodeblock %}

<p>Typical usage is to have a tag in the body of your email that references a per user substitution tag. This user tag will contain a reference to a section tag. Section text may contain references to per recipient substitution variables.</p>

Message body:
{% codeblock lang:html %}

 <body>

{% endcodeblock %}

<p>An accompanying SMTPAPI JSON header might look something like this:</p>

{% codeblock lang:json %}
X-SMTPAPI: {
  "to": ["john@bar.com","jane@baz.com","bill@baz.com"],
  "sub": {
    "-intro-": ["-greetGuy-", "-greetGirl-", "-greetBoy-"],
    "-name-": ["John", "Jane", "Bill"]
  },
  "section": {
    "-greetGuy-": "Mr. -name-",
    "-greetGirl-": "Ms. -name-",
    "-greetBoy-": "-name-"
  }
}
{% endcodeblock %}

The final email for Jane would look like this:
{% codeblock lang:html %}
<html>
 <body>
   Hi Ms. Jane,<br>
