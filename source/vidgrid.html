<p>SendGrid's Technical Support Engineers love to help people.  Several Engineers took the time to record video tech tips which we call Project VidGrid.  These tech tips cover many of the most important elements that you will need in order to quickly master our Newsletter application.  It has been said that 80% of what people learn is visual (Allen Klein) and we hope that these video tech tips help you learn.  If you have other topics that you would like to see covered on VidGrid please email us.</p>
