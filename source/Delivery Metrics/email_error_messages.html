<p>When you send an email, it must be accepted by the recipients mail server before anything else happens. These mail servers will always respond with numerical error messages to tell you the reason a particular mail server handled the message the way it did. Different mail servers use different phrasing for error messages, but the numeric codes are always the same. </p>

<p>On the <a href="http://sendgrid.com/logs/index">Email Activity</a> page, you can expand specific events to see the messages returned by the receiving mail server. Remember you can filter by specific email addresses by using the search field provided. You may also filter your search to only populate specific event types such as Requests, Bounces, Deferrals and Drops.</p>
