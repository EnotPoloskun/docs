<p>Enabling the Click Tracking App causes all the links in your emails to be overwritten and pointed to our servers so we can track clicks. If you would like a custom name to appear in the links you can create a CNAME that points to sendgrid.net and fill out the <a href="http://sendgrid.com/whitelabel/">Whitelabel</a> settings (only available in Silver or higher accounts) in your account with your new name.</p>
