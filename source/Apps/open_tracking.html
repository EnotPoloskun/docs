<p>The Open Tracking app adds an invisible image at the end of the email which can track e-mail opens. If the email recipient has images enabled on the email client, a request to server for the invisible image is executed and an open event is logged. These Events are logged in your <a href="/documentation/deliver-metrics/">Statistics</a> portal, the <a href="/documentation/deliver-metrics/email-activity/">Email Activity</a> interface, and are reported by the <a href="/documentation/api/event-api/">Event API</a>.</p>

<p>When using this service customers often ask the difference between a unique open versus an open.  A unique open is logged only the first time a given recipient opens the email whereas normal open's are logged for all opens of the email in question. </p>
