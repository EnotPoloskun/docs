We occasionally receive inquiries asking about our delivered email statistics and delivery monitoring capabilities.

_Delivered email _means we it was successfully sent and accepted by the destination's email server.

_Delivery monitoring_ is a constant activity at SendGrid. We regularly send samples of users' emails to predefined accounts that we actively monitor. This way we can determine actual delivery statistics for your account.
