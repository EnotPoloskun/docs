On the [Account Overview page](http://sendgrid.com/account/overview) of the SendGrid website, you can find your ** SendGrid account reputation**. This reputation is a indicator of how we view your email sending practices.

**How is Reputation Computed?**




The SendGrid account reputation is computed   
based on a number of factors including:






  * Total number of requests you've made to SendGrid (i.e. emails you've sent)


  * How many bounces you've received


  * How many spam reports you've received


  * How many unsubscribes you've received


  * How many invalid emails you've sent




**SendGrid's Reputation Policy:**




We regularly monitor our customers' account reputation for abuse and undesirable sending practices. Our general guidelines for account reputation take into account the following reputation thresholds:






  * **Reputation above 80%: **Congratulations, you have a good sending reputation and there are no issues at this time.


  * **Reputation between 70% and 80%:** This is considered a poor reputation and actions should be taken immediately to identify and fix problems with your sending practices.


  * **Reputation below 70%: **Accounts with reputations below 70% will be subject to immediate suspension or termination.
