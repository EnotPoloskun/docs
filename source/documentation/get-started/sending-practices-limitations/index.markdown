As you begin to use your SendGrid account there are some important things to remember. For example, Lite and Free packages have limitations in the amount of email that can be sent each day. Free accounts are simply limited to 200 emails per day, but the [equation](/documentation/get-started/sending-practices-limitations/lite-limitations/) for Lite packages is bit more complex.

Additionally, there are limitations to delivery rates imposed by recipient mail servers. Exceeding these limitations results in a practice referred to as throttling. [Throttling](/docs/email-deliverability/what-is-throttling/)Â in terms of email means that a recipient mail server has accepted all the mail it is willing to accept from your IP for a certain period of time.

_If you have a Silver or higher package, you really need to understand how to Warm Up Your IP to avoid having your outbound messaging throttled. [We've got a great page on warming up your IP just for that](http://docs.sendgrid.com/documentation/get-started/sending-practices-limitations/warming-up-your-ip-address/)!_
