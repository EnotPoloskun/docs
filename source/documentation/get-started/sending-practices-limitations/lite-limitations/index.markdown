title: Lite Email Sending Limitations
wordpress_id: 950
---

Our Lite package has a bandwidth restriction to keep spammers from abusing our system. For the first 7 days you will be limited to 1,000 emails per day. After the 7th day we look into how many emails you have sent, how many days your account has been active, and check your reputation status. As the value of each of these parameters increases, your volume limitations will decrease.

As you achieve each guideline after the 7-day period, your account limit will be raised incrementally. You must achieve all guidelines in one row before you can achieve any guideline on the next row. The below table lists the limitation factors, and how they affect your total.

For example:



	
  * If you have a 10 day old account (+3,000), have sent 10,000 messages (+0), and have a reputation of 91% (+3,000), you would have a Daily Send Limit of 7,000.

	
  * If you have a 15 day old account, have sent 49,000 messages, and have a reputation of 99%, you would have a Daily Send Limit of 7,000, because you can't achieve the 14-day guideline until you achieve the 50,000-messages guideline.


Please note that if your reputation declines, your limit will decrease accordingly. All these values are checked overnight, so they won't update the moment you reach the next increment of any given parameter.
