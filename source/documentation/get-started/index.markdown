**First off, we'd just like to say, Good Job.** You've opted to use SendGrid, and that, by association, makes you cool. Making that leap, however, is only going to get you part of the way. Now it's time for us to catch you and carry you to the other side, and that means the integration of SendGrid into your application. Now, you are going to make a choice. Don't worry, though. You are free to use any and/or all of our large number of integration points. So, [you can jump straight to our Integration page](http://docs.sendgrid.com/documentation/get-started/integrate/) or shortcut to one of the sections by clicking on one of the appropriate and convenient icons below.

> **NOTE >> **NOW, before you start your integration, there's one note we'd like to make. If you have opted for a Silver package or higher plan, be sure to run the [Whitelabel Wizard](/documentation/get-started/whitelabel-wizard/) before sending email through your new account for optimal delivery rates. _It is also super important to note that if you are using a Silver Package or above, you will want to [Warm Up your IP](http://docs.sendgrid.com/documentation/get-started/sending-practices-limitations/warming-up-your-ip-address/) to avoid being throttled by recipient servers, as this will cause delays in delivery_. That's not good, so we felt it was important to mention again.



Perhaps even more importantly, don't forget that you are at liberty to lean on our support team anytime you have questions that our documentation pages can't answer. Tell them that the Docs site sent you, and they'll understand.
