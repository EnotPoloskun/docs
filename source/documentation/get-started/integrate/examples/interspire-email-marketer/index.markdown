Interspire's Email Marketer is a powerful email marketing tool used by some SendGrid customers to carry out more in-depth marketing campaigns. Interspire makes the integration process simple and straightforward. You will first need to login to your account. Once you have successfully logged in, go to **Settings > Email Settings**, as shown below.

At the bottom of the Email Settings page, you will find the Mail Server Details section. This is where you opt to use the default settings or elect to configure your own server. Select the second option, as indicated in the image below.

Once you've activated the option to specify your own SMTP server, you can enter the necessary details that will enable SendGrid SMTP for Interspire. Enter the following details:




	
  * **SMTP Hostname** - smtp.sendgrid.com, as you see can above

	
  * **SMTP Username** - Please enter your SendGrid username (i.e., your email address)

	
  * **SMTP Password** - Make sure to enter your password

	
  * **SMTP Port** - 587, as shown above





> **TIP >> **It's a really, really good idea to test these settings before committing, that way you know it works before you get errors.





> **WARNING >> **Make sure to enter your own credentials. Bob gets a bit picky about who uses his account (primarily because he's not real).
