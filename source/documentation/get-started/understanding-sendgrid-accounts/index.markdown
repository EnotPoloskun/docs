We're pleased as punch that you've decided to take a look at SendGrid. Now, let’s make sure you stay happy, and that requires a good start. Setting up an account is simple. You can do that now, if you like. Just [ go to to our account selection page ](http://sendgrid.com/pricing.html) or you can click one of the links below when you find an account level you like.

If you want more information before making your selection, you’re in the right place. We understand that those feature check lists can be a tad annoying on occasion, so here’s some explanatory text to help you make a selection:



	
  * **All Accounts** – No matter which plan you end up selecting, every single one gets access to our robust standard deliverability, reporting, and analytics features. You also get to bend the ear of our technical support team.

	
  * **Lite** – SendGrid Lite gives you ala carte, pay-as-you-go access to all of our basic deliverability and reporting service features. This is a great choice if your transactional mail volume changes based on variable vectors (i.e., Halloween costume stores, As Seen On TV products, etc…) and you don’t need access to swank features like whitelabeling or our more advanced APIs. We do place some special limitations on the Lite plan, so you should read about the limitations before selecting this option. [Cool. Sign me up with this.](https://sendgrid.com/user/signup/package/77)

	
  * **Bronze** – SendGrid Bronze is the first block-rate account you can select, giving you 40,000 emails a month for just $10. We also throw in Advanced Reporting and Analytics. This account is fantastic for smaller organizations like your village’s British tea & scones shoppe advertising the owner’s latest self-defense classes or your town’s local biker gang sending out quilting club newsletters. [I like! Sign me up here!](http://sendgrid.com/user/signup/package/78)

	
  * ** Silver ** – Now you can unlock all of SendGrid’s potential. For $80 a month, you get to send 100,000 emails and have access to all of our gnarly features. Yes. We said gnarly. [Wicked! I want this one!](http://sendgrid.com/user/signup/package/11)

	
  * ** Gold ** – Move up to Captain Jean Luc Picard cool to have a credit limit of 300,000 emails a month for just $200. Fantabulous! [Make it so, Number One!](http://sendgrid.com/user/signup/package/12)

	
  * ** Platinum ** – Welcome to the bridge, Capt. Kirk. You’re pushing warp 9.8 with a monthly credit for 700,000 emails for just $400. [Outstanding! As awesome as a containment breach!](http://sendgrid.com/user/signup/package/44)

	
  * ** Free ** – We deeply enjoy being nice (it’s a zen thing), so we also have a free option that gives you 200 messages sent per day for zilch and you get access to the same features available to the Lite plan. [Sweet! This is more than enough for my underwater basketweaving enthusiast group newsletter.](http://sendgrid.com/user/signup)


You can hop on over to the sign up page or feel free to run through our detailed sign-up instructions before you begin.


# The Sign-Up


![](http://docs.sendgrid.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/acctsetup02.png)

Once you are ready to roll you can simply select the SendGrid plan you want, and fill out the form. You will create a username and a password and fill out our contact form. Please note that all fields are required (ok, not Address 2), so be as accurate as possible. This also helps up weed out spammers who generally prefer not to give out their real contact information.



> **TIP >> **Creating a helpful username >> ** Unlike typical online services, SendGrid is a tool to be used with applications that send email. Considering that, you may want to choose a more service-oriented username. For example, let’s say that Seattle Baseline Development Corp. set up an account. They might want to use something like ** sbdcmail ** or ** sbdcsmtp ** . We also suggest that you do not include words like “admin” or “login” in the username.



Once you submit the form, our unsurprisingly capable email servers will send you a validation email to make sure you’re not a bot. With all of the initial process complete, you can start setting up your account. You will be presented with the Account Setup Wizard, as seen in the image below. The first two items of the Wizard are described as follows:



	
  * ** Confirm Email ** – This one’s on you. Once you successfully completed the sign-up form, you should have received an email with a confirmation link. If it doesn’t arrive within one hour, click on the (+) and then click the link _ Send Confirmation Again _ .

	
  * ** Account Provisioning ** – This one’s on us. Once you’ve confirmed your account, our crack team will review your account details and begin the provisioning process. Once that’s done, that item will be checked off, and you can login to your account and starting configuring your account settings.




Now you’re ready to move on to the next step >> ** _ [Configuring Account Settings](http://docs.sendgrid.com/documentation/get-started/configuring-your-account/) _ **
