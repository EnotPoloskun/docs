The Manage Sender Addresses tool allows you to manage any and all of the Sender Addresses you have created for the express purpose of compliance with the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003. If any of the required details change, then you are required by the CAN-SPAM Act to update the information.  




> **NOTE >> **The term 'Sender Identity' has been changed to 'Sender Address'.



The creation of a Sender Address allows all of your messages which meet the CAN-SPAM definition of having Commercial content, or combines Transactional and/or Relationship content with Commercial content, to be sent to voluntary recipients in full compliance.  




> **WARNING >> **In order to be fully compliant with CAN-SPAM, we strongly urge you to make yourself very, very familiar with the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 and it's associated details. [An excellent start is the CAN-SPAM Act: A Compliance Guide for Business page at the Bureau of Consumer Protection website](http://business.ftc.gov/documents/bus61-can-spam-act-compliance-guide-business/).
