The Newsletter App is a powerful web based tool that allows you to compose and send email from your SendGrid account. The newsletter can be used to do A/B split testing, scheduled delivery, list management, and includes advanced Newsletter specific statistics. Directly from the App you can upload your newsletter to facebook or twitter, you can download a list of all customers who opened your newsletter, and much more!

The Newsletter App also has a [Newsletter API](http://docs.sendgrid.com/documentation/api/newsletter-api/)Â to automate interaction with the tool.
