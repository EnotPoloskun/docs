The Return Path Seedlist App allows customers to easily use Return Path's Mailbox Monitor feature to send email to a Seedlist of top recipient servers and examine delivery rates across that list. The seed list covers more than 130 domains including the top ISPs in the U.S., European, Canadian, Latin American and Asia Pacific markets. The list itself will be provided by Return Path.
