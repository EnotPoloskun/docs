The Event Notification App controls notifications for events, such as bounces, clicks, opens, and more. This App allows these events to be posted to a URL of your choosing, and will create a dynamic and easily digestible format in which the data points you have selected will populate. The Event Notification App is a superior alternative to using [Alert Settings](http://sendgrid.com/alerts/) from your Account Dashboard. See more detailed information on using the [Event API](http://docs.sendgrid.com/documentation/api/event-api/) in conjunction with this App.
