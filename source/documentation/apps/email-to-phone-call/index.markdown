Send a voice phone message to any US phone number. We take the text portion of the email, convert it to voice and then feed it to a phone call.


  

To send a message, add 9998887766@phone to the _To:_ field where 9998887766 is the 10 digit US phone number you want to call. The email must be plain text.
