The [Email Activity](http://sendgrid.com/logs/index) page allows you to view a real time log of all the email that has been sent on your account. These logs display all events (delivered, bounce, open, etc) and can be viewed by the most recent activity, or searched by email addresses.  




> **NOTE >> **Email activity only shows you either a total of 7 days or the 500 most recent events of any query, whichever is . In order to access more data, you may want to consider using our [Event API](http://docs.sendgrid.com/documentation/api/event-api/).



When viewing Email Activity logs you can expand specific events to see more details for that event. Remember you can filter by specific email addresses by using the search field provided.

You may also filter your search to only populate specific event types such as Requests, Bounces, Deferrals, Drops etc. You can also alter the number of results returned for each result. In order to apply constraints to your search parameters, click on the Search Options link, as shown in the image below.
