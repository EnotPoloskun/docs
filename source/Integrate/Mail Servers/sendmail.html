<p><span class="label label-warning">Warning</span> Sendmail requires libsasl in order to properly send authentication requests to SendGrid servers. The saslauthd server daemon is not required unless you plan to receive authentication requests to the same server. <a href="http://www.sendmail.com/sm/open_source/tips/compiling_sendmail/#SASL">For more information on configuring sendmail for SASL support, check the official documentation</a>.</p>

Set the authorization credentials in <strong>/etc/mail/access</strong>
``` bash
AuthInfo:smtp.sendgrid.net "U:yourUserName" "P:yourPassword" "M:PLAIN"
```

Define the Smart Host in <strong>/etc/mail/sendmail.mc</strong>
You should add these lines just after the commented 
"#dnl define('SMART_HOST', 'smtp.your.provider')dnl" line in the file

``` bash
define('SMART_HOST', 'smtp.sendgrid.net')dnl
FEATURE('access_db')dnl
define('RELAY_MAILER_ARGS', 'TCP $h 587')dnl
define('ESMTP_MAILER_ARGS', 'TCP $h 587')dnl
```

Update sendmail.cf and access.db files
(You will need to run these commands as 'su' or 'root')
``` bash
$ cd /etc/mail
$ m4 sendmail.mc >sendmail.cf
$ makemap hash access < access
```

On older distros, you can run restart sendmail like so:
``` bash
$ /etc/init.d/sendmail restart
```

If, however, you're using a newer version, do the following to restart:
``` bash
$ service sendmail restart
```
