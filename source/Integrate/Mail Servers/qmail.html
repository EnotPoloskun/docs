<p>Qmail does not come with SMTP authentication functionality installed. Check out this <a href="http://www.differentpla.net/content/2004/03/installing-smtp-auth-with-qmail">guide to forms of authentication and adding the netqmail TLS+SMTPauth patch.</a></p>

<p>Alternately, you can <a href="http://www.fehcom.de/qmail/smtpauth.html">take a look at Fehcom's very complete description of authentication on mail servers</a>, or just jump down to the section about <a href="http://www.fehcom.de/qmail/smtpauth.html##SETUP">configuring SMTPAUTH for qmail</a>.</p>

<p>In general, you will need to add the following to <strong>/var/qmail/control/smtproutes</strong>, but you should verify the actual path and file you need to update.</p>

```
:smtp.sendgrid.net:587 username password
```

As with all configuration changes, make sure to restart qmail.
