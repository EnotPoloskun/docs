<p>Categories help organize your email analytics by enabling you to tag emails by type.</p>

<p>Just as you can view the statistics on all your activity under the '<a href="/Delivery Metrics/">Statistics</a>' tab, you can go a step further and view the statistics on a particular category.</p>

<p>The events that can be associated with category include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Emails sent</li>
	<li>Clicks</li>
	<li>Opens</li>
	<li>Bounces</li>
	<li>Spam Reports</li>
	<li>Unsubscribes</li>
</ul>
<p>The actual statistics included vary depending upon the set of enabled <a href="/Apps/">Apps</a>. Emails sent, bounces and spam reports will always get tracked. Unsubscribes, Clicks, and Opens require that the associated App is enabled.</p>

<blockquote><span class="label label-info">Info</span> Currently, there is no limit to the number of categories you can track, but there is a limit of ten (10) categories that can be applied to each email you send.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="label label-info">Info</span> Categories should be used to group messages together. If you need to attach unique data or identifiers to a message, use Unique Arguments instead.</blockquote>

<h2>Example</h2>
<p>You can use SendGrid's <a href="/API%20Reference/SMTP%20API/">SMTPAPI</a> to add these categories to your email. The following should be added to the email's header:</p>

{% codeblock lang:javascript %}
X-SMTPAPI: {"category": "Example Category"}
{% endcodeblock %}
<p>In this example, SendGrid would associate statistics for the email containing that header with the category <strong>Example Category</strong>.</p>
