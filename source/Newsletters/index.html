<p>SendGrid's Newsletter tool is a powerful web and API based interface that allows you to compose and send scheduled marketing campaigns from your SendGrid account. Newsletters can be split tested, lists can be managed, and recipients can manage their subscriptions. You can upload your newsletter to facebook or twitter directly from SendGrid, and much more!</p>
