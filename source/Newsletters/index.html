SendGrid's Newsletter tool is a powerful web and API based interface that allows you to compose and send scheduled marketing campaigns from your SendGrid account. Newsletters can be split tested, lists can be managed, and recipients can manage their subscriptions. You can upload your newsletter to facebook or twitter directly from SendGrid, you can download a list of all customers who opened your newsletter, and much more!

For information on programmatically interfacing with SendGrid newsletters, check out the <a href="{{ root_url }}/API%20Reference/Newsletter%20API">Newsletter API</a> documentation.
