<h2 id="what_is_sendgrid">What is SendGrid?</h2>

<p>SendGrid is a cloud-based <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMTP" title="SMTP on Wikipedia">SMTP provider</a> that allows you to send email without having to maintain email servers. SendGrid manages all of the technical details, from scaling the infrastructure to ISP outreach and reputation monitoring to whitelist services and real time analytics. </p>

<p>Our goal is to make it as easy as possible to add reliable, scalable email to your application so that you can focus on building the core features of your product.</p>

<p>For developers, it's super easy to get started. To send email through SendGrid from your code, just change your email configuration to point to our servers and include the credentials for your SendGrid account, and you're done. If you're not already sending email from your app, we have a variety of <a href="/Integrate/index.html">integration options</a> for you.</p>
